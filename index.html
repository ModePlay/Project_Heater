            than 8 inches to maintain resistance.

            Should be able to sit down and then press bars

            out to get a feel for it.

            remaining 3 sets. Since you're doing flat bench 
            free press you may want to 'incline' these pushups.

            arms-the arms follow. As you bring your elbows down
            to your sides, think about and squeeze your back 
            and hold there for just a second.

            10lbs/side to start. Same as lats, yes your arm
            will move, but focus so the majority of the
            row comes from the back not your arm.
            If you started with your right side last set, 
            start with your left on the next and so on....

        <td>12</td>
        <td>5lbs/arm is plenty to start. Or do it without
            weight at first to get a feel. Stand with knees
            slightly bent. Bend at waist so torso is
            parallel to the ground as can be. Chin up and 
            head forward. Keeping arms straight with a 
            slight bend in your elbows, flair your arms
            up and out to the sides squeezing your shoulders
            at the top--that's where you want focus. DON'T
            try and hold the weight up at the top of the lift.
            Should be smooth and fluid reps almost like you're
            flapping wings.

            lower back. Legs slightly more than shoulder-width
            apart. Arms above your head and imagine a box in 
            your hands. Bend at the waist (push butt out) only so far as keeping
            your back and pelvis aligned will allow, then let your
            arms drop further to place the 'box' at your feet.
            Then push your hips forward as you pick the 'box' back
            up and overhead. Your legs should not move at all.
