                    as you can, gradually increasing the size until the circles 
                    are as big as you can draw, then gradually reduce the size.
                    When the circles are once again small as can be, Repeat in the 
                    reverse direction. Take a break and do it all one more time.

                    up, with calves parallel to the floor so your legs make a 90 deg 
                    angle and hold. The trick, is to not let your back arch off the 
                    floor and maintain your pelvic tilt.
